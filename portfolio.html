                <p>My name is Ashwin Narayanan. I’d like to start off by saying thank you for taking your time out to visit my website. As a first-year student at Carleton University and Dev Degree Intern at Shopify, I am an extremely passionate and self-driven
                    individual looking to build strong professional connections as I enter the real world.
                </p><br>

                <p>I am consistently seeking new opportunities and experiences in rich and resourceful learning environments where I can develop my knowledge and hone my leadership abilities. I am strongly interested in the fields of web development, hardware
                    and software engineering, and technological innovation.
                </p><br>

                <p>Apart from this, in my free time, I enjoy competing in my outdoor sports such as soccer and tennis. As a pianist for the last 10 years, I enjoy playing new pieces and performing at competitions and concerts. I also have a strong interest in
                    photography, public speaking, and I am always exploring for opportunities that will help me develop myself in the activities I partake in.
